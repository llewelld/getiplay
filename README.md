# GetiPlay

GetiPlay is a simple user interface for the get_iplayer command line utility for Sailfish OS devices. It allows TV and radio programmes to be downloaded from the BBC iPlayer listings.

## Dependencies

Makes use of get_iplayer to do the actual work, which itself relies on ffmpeg for video conversion.

get_iplayer: https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer

ffmpeg: http://ffmpeg.org/

The version of GetiPlay on OpenRepos comes bundled with these binaries (compiled directly from source) along with the Perl dependencies needed to run get_iplayer.

## Compatibility

GetiPlay has been tested on Sailfish 2.1.4.14 Lapuanjoki. However, it's currently in a beta state so comes with no guarantees that it'll work correctly, although I'd be grateful for any bug reports.

## Licence

GetiPlay is released under an MIT License. See the LICENSE file for the full details. Other components have difference licences (e.g. get_iplayer is GPLv3).
